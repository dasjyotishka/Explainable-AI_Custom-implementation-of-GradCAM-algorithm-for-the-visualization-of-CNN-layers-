# Explainable-AI_Custom-implementation-of-GradCAM-algorithm-for-the-visualization-of-CNN-layers-

##Objective
Convolutional Neural Networks are widely used on computer vision. It is powerful for processing grid-like data. However we hardly know how and why it works, due to the lack of decomposability into individually intuitive components. In this assignment for the course on Advanced Deep Learning at CentraleSup√©lec, a custom implementation of Grad-CAM algorithm was created, which highlights the regions of the input image that were important for the neural network prediction.
